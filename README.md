  Use Spring JPA to model the data in the prompt below. 
  
  Suppose you are working for a telecom company. The data requirements of the organization are outlined below. 
  
 - The telecom company has multiple Plans. Each Plan has a number maximum number of call minutes, a maximum number of text messages, a monthly rate (this is the monthly cost), a long-distance rate,  a fee for every 60 minutes of call time above the maximum allowed, and a fee for every 100 text messages above the maximum allowed. 
 - There are 3 types of plans: PayAsYouGoPlan, StandardContractPlan, PremiumContractPlan. 
  - The StandardContractPlan and PremiumContractPlan both have a maximum amount of data usage and a fee for every additional GB of data above the maximum allowed. 
  - The PremiumContractPlan has a long-distance rate of zero. 
- The telecom company has Users. Users have a name, shipping Address, billing Address, primary phone number, and a list of Accounts.
- Address has streetAddress, city, country, and postalCode. 
- The company requires a table of valid Postal Codes that can be used to verify any newly input postalCode.
- Accounts have a status (ACTIVE, DELINQUENT, CANCELLED), a map of Users and their phone numbers (this may be a single User or multiple Users in the case of a family-style plan), a primary User, and a Plan.

The telecom company must be able to query the database to find:

- Users by name
- Users by phoneNumber
- Accounts by User primary phone number
- A count of all users with a certain type of plan

**You must have adequate test coverage**
**You must use the Money class for all monetary values**
